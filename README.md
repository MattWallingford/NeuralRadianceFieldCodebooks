# [Neural Radiance Field Codebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04101)


Pytorch implementation for **Neural Radiance Field Codebooks** (ICLR 2023). 

### Abstract
Compositional representations of the world are a promising step towards enabling
high-level scene understanding and efficient transfer to downstream tasks. Learning
such representations for complex scenes and tasks remains an open challenge. Towards this goal, we introduce Neural Radiance Field Codebooks ( NRC ), a scalable
method for learning object-centric representations through novel view reconstruc-
tion. NRC learns to reconstruct scenes from novel views using a dictionary of
object codes which are decoded through a volumetric renderer. This enables the
discovery of reoccurring visual and geometric patterns across scenes which are
transferable to downstream tasks
